  // FAQ

      question: "What's the difference between UI and UX?",
      answer:
        "UX (User Experience) focuses on the overall user journey, usability, and how the product feels. UI (User Interface) focuses on the visual design, layout, and interactive elements. We excel at both - creating beautiful interfaces (UI) that provide exceptional experiences (UX).",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does UI/UX design take?",
      answer:
        "Timeline depends on project scope. A complete website redesign typically takes 8-12 weeks. Mobile apps take 12-16 weeks. We work in iterative sprints, delivering value at each stage and providing regular updates throughout the process.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will this actually improve conversions?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Every design decision we make is backed by conversion optimization principles. Our clients typically see 25-40% improvements in key conversion metrics. We track and measure results to ensure designs deliver real business value.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with existing developers?",
      answer:
        "Yes! We specialize in collaborative workflows. We provide detailed design specs, component libraries, and regular syncs with development teams. Our handoff process includes everything developers need for smooth implementation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you redesign an existing product?",
      answer:
        "Definitely. We start with a comprehensive audit of your current design, identifying pain points and opportunities. Our redesigns preserve what works while modernizing and optimizing for better performance and conversions.",
