  // FAQ
  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "How is AI Search Optimization different from SEO?",
      answer:
        "Traditional SEO optimizes for link-based search ranking. AI Search Optimization focuses on entity recognition, brand authority, and being selected by AI as a trustworthy source for direct answers. It's about becoming an AI-recognized expert, not just ranking for keywords.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will this replace traditional SEO?",
      answer:
        "No, they complement each other. Traditional SEO remains important for website traffic, while AI Search Optimization ensures visibility in AI-generated answers and next-generation search platforms. We recommend an integrated approach for complete search visibility.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results?",
      answer:
        "Initial entity recognition improvements can appear within 4-6 weeks. Significant AI visibility and citation growth typically takes 3-6 months. The process involves building AI trust and authority, which develops over time through consistent optimization.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can small businesses benefit?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. AI search levels the playing field by focusing on expertise and authority rather than budget. Small businesses with clear expertise can achieve significant AI visibility faster than through traditional SEO competition.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this safe and future-proof?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Our methods focus on ethical authority building, quality content, and proper structured data—all practices that align with AI development trends. This creates sustainable visibility as AI search evolves.",
